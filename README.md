# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

> Version 1.0.0.1

A simple but rather classic Tic-Tac-Toe game project powered by React

![tic-tac-toe.gif](./public/tic-tac-toe.gif)

What is being **used** in this project:
- React's **useState** hook to track multiple game variables
- React's **Component** features to model each of the game's parts

## How to use

1. The game will set the player's turns automatically.
2. Click on the **Square** on which you want your mark on.
3. The app will detect **automatically** which player won.

## Roadmap of future improvements

A player can click on a square changing the mark even if it was marked, a **lock** on marked squares fix will come.
